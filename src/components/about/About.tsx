              With a foundation from Le Wagonâ€™s intensive bootcamp, I began my
              journey into web development, mastering Ruby on Rails and gaining
              a solid understanding of front-end fundamentals. Driven by a
              passion for building interactive applications, I delved into
              JavaScript and React through an online class with Scrimba. I
              continued to advance my skills by learning Next.js independently,
              creating various projects that allowed me to apply and strengthen
              my knowledge.

              After a year of hands-on practice, including an internship,
              I&apos;m eager to take on new challenges as a front-end developer,
              ready to contribute to innovative projects with my growing
              expertise.
